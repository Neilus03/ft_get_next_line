The number 42 is often associated with a humorous reference in Douglas Adams' science fiction series "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy." In the story, a supercomputer named Deep Thought is asked to find the answer to the ultimate question of life, the universe, and everything. After much contemplation, Deep Thought reveals that the answer is simply the number 42. 

Although the number 42 itself may not have a specific meaning in the context of the story, it has gained significant popularity and has become a symbol of the quest for the meaning of life. It represents the idea that the answer to profound questions may not always be logical or easily comprehensible.

In a broader sense, the relevance of the number 42 as an answer to every question in the universe is that it highlights the inherent complexity and ambiguity of existence. It reminds us that some mysteries may never be fully understood, and that the pursuit of knowledge and understanding is a continuous journey.

So, whenever you encounter a challenging question or seek a deeper understanding of the world around you, remember the number 42 and embrace the quest for meaning and knowledge.
